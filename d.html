            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Mamallapuram</strong> (also known as Mahabalipuram (Mamallapuram) is a historic town located on
                the southeastern coast of India in Tamil Nadu, about 60 km south of Chennai. It is famous for its
                ancient rock-cut temples, cave sanctuaries, and monumental sculptures, which date back to the Pallava
                dynasty (7th–8th century CE).
                <br>
                <br>
                The town is renowned for its Shore Temple, Pancha Rathas (Five Chariots), and descriptive open-air
                bas-reliefs, including the famous “Descent of the Ganges”. These architectural marvels reflect a blend
                of Hindu religious traditions, art, and Dravidian style architecture.
                <br>
                <br>
                Mahabalipuram is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site, attracting tourists, historians, and art enthusiasts
                from around the world. Besides its cultural significance, it is known for its scenic beaches and annual
                dance festivals.
            </p>


            <h2>Etymology</h2>
            <h3> “Mamallapuram” Origin:</h3>
            The town was originally called “Mamallapuram”, meaning “the town of Mamalla”.
            Mamalla was the title of King Narasimhavarman I of the Pallava dynasty, who was a great warrior and patron
            of architecture.
            <h3>“Mahabalipuram” Transformation:</h3>
            Over time, the name changed to Mahabalipuram, possibly influenced by folk pronunciation or regional
            dialects.
            Some interpretations link “Mahabali” to great strength or greatness, reflecting the legacy of the Pallava
            kings.
            <h3> Meaning:</h3>
            Essentially, the name refers to a “city of the great warrior king” and highlights its historical
            significance as a center of art, architecture, and culture during the Pallava period.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Mahabalipuram, also known as Mamallapuram, has a rich history dating back to the Pallava dynasty (4th–9th
                century CE). The town was an important port city on the Coromandel Coast, facilitating trade with
                Southeast Asia, China, and the Roman Empire.
                <br>
                <br>

                The Pallava kings, especially King Narasimhavarman I (also called Mamalla, “great wrestler”), patronized
                the construction of rock-cut temples, cave shrines, monolithic structures, and open-air bas-reliefs.
                These monuments were both religious centers and symbols of Pallava power and artistry.
                <br>
                <br>

                Mahabalipuram’s architecture includes the famous Shore Temple, Pancha Rathas (Five Chariots), Varaha
                Cave, and the Descent of the Ganges bas-relief, showcasing early Dravidian style and innovative rock-cut
                techniques.
                <br>
                <br>

                Over time, the town declined as a major port due to silting and natural changes in the coastline, but it
                retained its cultural and religious significance. Today, Mahabalipuram is recognized as a UNESCO World
                Heritage Site, celebrated for its historic monuments and exquisite craftsmanship.
